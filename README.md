# Circl Up ðŸŽ‰

**Circl Up** is a school project app designed to connect people through real-life events in Skopje.

### Concept
Users explore a city map with events pinned at popular venues (e.g., concerts, parties). Each event shows its title, location, and time, and users can register to attend.

### How It Works
During an event, participants are randomly paired. Each pair takes photos together and uploads them. If both photos confirm the match, the users earn points, which can later unlock rewards. Pairings can happen multiple times to ensure everyone connects.

### Features
- **Event Map** â€“ discover and register for events.
- **Event Details** â€“ see where and when events happen.
- **Pairing Challenges** â€“ meet new people and earn points.
- **Profiles** â€“ showcase photos from past events and connections.

### Vision
Circl Up encourages extroverts to step out, meet strangers, and build memories through playful challengesâ€”turning events into opportunities for lasting friendships.
